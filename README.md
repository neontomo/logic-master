# Logic Master

As I tried to learn how logic gates work myself, I built a tool to visualize the connections between them as I know that getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn difficult problems.

A playable version is available at [https://neontomo.com/play/logic-master](https://neontomo.com/play/logic-master)

Have fun and experiment with it! You may edit my code and re-use it if you credit me in the source code.
